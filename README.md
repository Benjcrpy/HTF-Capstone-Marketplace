## Getting Started

## Tools

- React
- TypeScirpt
- Charak
- Solidity

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter (name of the project)
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your application.


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file for all the environment variables required and add it to `.env.local` file or set them up on your hosting provider.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy / npm deploy
```
